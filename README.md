## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to build a Martini 3 topology for an ionizable lipid. The aim is to have a pragmatic description of the Martini 3 coarse-graining (CGing) principles [1,2], which follow the main ideas outlined in the seminal Martini 2 work [3].

We will use as an example the molecule SM-102 (Fig. 1), and make use of Gromacs versions 2024.x or later. Required files and worked examples can be downloaded here.

## 1) Generate atomistic reference data

We will need atomistic reference data to extract bonded parameters for the CG model. Note that we will need all the hydrogen atoms to extract bond lengths further down this tutorial, so make sure that your atomistic structure contains all the hydrogens.

Here, we will use the LigParGen server [6] as a way to obtain an atomistic (or all-atom, AA) structure and molecule topology based on the OPLS-AA force field, but of course feel free to use your favorite atomistic force field. Other web-based services such as the automated topology builder (ATB) or CHARMM-GUI can also be used to obtain reference topologies based on other AA force fields. Another important option is to look in the literature for atomistic studies of the molecule you want to parametrize: if you are lucky, somebody might have already published a validated atomistic force field for the molecule, which you can then use to create reference atomistic simulations.

Start by feeding the SMILES string for 1-ethylnaphthalene (namely, CCc1cccc2ccccc21) to the LigParGen server, and pick the "1.14*CM1A-LBCC (Neutral molecules)" charge model (nothing special about this choice of charge model). After submitting the molecule, the server will generate input parameters for several molecular dynamics (MD) packages. Download the structure file (PDB) as well as the OPLS-AA topology in the GROMACS format (TOP) and rename them ENAP_LigParGen.pdb and ENAP_LigParGen.itp, respectively. You can now unzip the zip archive provided:

```
unzip  files-m3-newsm.zip
```

which contains a folder called ENAP-in-water that contains some template folders and useful scripts. We will assume that you will be carrying out the tutorial using this folder structure and scripts. Note that the archive contains also a folder called ENAP-worked where you will find a worked version of the tutorial (trajectories not included). This might be useful to use as reference to compare your files (e.g., to compare the ENAP_LigParGen.itp you obtained with the one you find in ENAP-worked/1_AA-reference).

We can now move to the first subfolder, 1_AA-reference, and copy over the files you just obtained from the LigParGen server:
```
cd     ENAP-in-water/1_AA-reference
[move here the obtained ENAP_LigParGen.pdb and ENAP_LigParGen.itp files]
```
Input files obtained from LigParGen may come with unknown residue names. Before launching the AA MD simulation, we will substitute the UNK residue name by ENAP. To do so, open the ENAP_LigParGen.pdb with your text editor of choice and replace the UNK entries on the 4th column of the ATOM records section. This column defines the residue name on a PDB file. Now open the ENAP_LigParGen.itp file and replace the UNK entries under the [ moleculetype ] directive and on the 4th column of the [ atoms ] directive. These define the residue name in a GROMACS topology file. (A lengthier discussion on GROMACS topology files will be given in section 4).) Alternatively, the following command - that relies on the Unix utility sed - will replace any UNK occurrence with ENAP (note the extra space after UNK which is important to keep the formatting of the pdb file!):

```
sed -i 's/UNK /ENAP/' ENAP_LigParGen.pdb
sed -i 's/UNK /ENAP/' ENAP_LigParGen.itp
```

Now launch the AA MD simulation:

```
bash prepare_1mol_AA_system.sh  ENAP_LigParGen.pdb  spc216.gro  SOL  3
```

The last command will run an energy-minimization, followed by an NPT equilibration of 250 ps, and by an MD run of 10 ns (inspect the script and the various mdp files to know more). Note that 10 ns is a rather short simulation time, selected for speeding up the current tutorial. You should rather use at least 50 ns, or an even longer running time in case of more complex molecules (you can try to experiment with the simulation time yourself!). In this case, the solvent used is water; however, the script can be adapted to run with any other solvent, provided that you input also an equilibrated solvent box. You should choose a solvent that represents the environment where the molecule will spend most of its time.

## 2) Atom-to-bead mapping

Mapping, i.e., splitting the molecule in building blocks to be described by CG beads, is the heart of coarse-graining and relies on experience, chemical knowledge, and trial-and-error. Here are some guidelines you should follow when mapping a molecule to a Martini 3 model
   * only non-hydrogen atoms are considered to define the mapping;
   * avoid dividing specific chemical groups (e.g., amide or carboxylate) between two beads;
    respect the symmetry of the molecule; it is moreover desirable to retain as much as possible the volume and shape of the underlying AA structure;
    default option for 4-to-1, 3-to-1 and 2-to-1 mappings are regular (R), small (S), and tiny (T) beads; they are the default option for linear fragments, e.g., the two 4-to-1 segments in octane;
   * R-beads are the best option in terms of computational performance, with the bead size reasonably good to represent 4-to-1 linear molecules;
   * T-beads are especially suited to represent the flatness of aromatic rings;
   * S-beads usually better mimic the "bulkier" shape of aliphatic rings;
    the number of beads should be optimized such that the maximum mismatch in mapping is Â±1 non-hydrogen atom per 10 non-hydrogen atoms of the atomistic structure;
  * fully branched fragments should usually use beads of smaller size (the rational being that the central atom of a branched group is buried, that is, it is not exposed to the environment, reducing its influence on the interactions); for example, a neopentane group contains 5 non-hydrogen atoms but, as it is fully branched, you can safely model it as a regular bead.

In this example, first of all it is important to realize that, within Martini 3, conjugated, atom-thick structures are best described by Tiny (T) beads. This ensures packing-related properties closely matching atomistic data [1]-[2]. In this case, the 10 carbon atoms of the naphthalene moiety are therefore mapped to 5 T-beads, as shown in the figure below:

</p>

Which leaves us with the ethyl group. A T-bead is again a good choice because the T-bead size is suited for describing 2 non-hydrogen atoms. Note that, the beads have also been numbered in the figure for further reference.

A good idea to settle on a mapping is to draw your molecule a few times on a piece of paper, come up with several mappings, compare them, and choose the one that best fulfills the guidelines outlined above.
