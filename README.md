# Parametrizing a ionizable lipid to Martini3
This tutorial aims to showcase the parametrization of ionizable lipids to Martini3.

Adapted from the [Parametrization of a new small molecule](https://github.com/ricalessandri/Martini3-small-molecules/blob/main/tutorials/M3tutorials--parameterizing-a-new-small-molecule.md) Martini 3 Tutorial.

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to build a Martini 3 topology for an ionizable lipid. The aim is to have a pragmatic description of the Martini 3 coarse-graining (CGing) principles [1,2], which follow the main ideas outlined in the seminal Martini 2 work [3].

We will use as an example the molecule SM-102 (Fig. 1), and make use of Gromacs versions 2024.x or later. Required files and worked examples can be downloaded here.
